# Share Store

## Description  

Share Store allows users to register, log in, upload files, and manage access permissions for those files. Users can share their files with specific individuals or make them accessible to everyone. Additionally, users can view files shared with them by others. Share Store employs **Cloudinary** for file storage and retrieval. It provides features like user authentication, file upload/download, access control, password change, and account deletion, making it a versatile file-sharing platform.

## Updates
- **Discord Integration:** Enhanced the platform with a new feature that automates the process of uploading files `(college lecture slides in my case)` to Discord. Now, when users upload files containing specific keywords (e.g., lecture names or topics like Math or TOC) from their accounts, these files are automatically sent to a designated Discord channel, as specified in the environment variables. This integration eliminates the need for manual file transfers, saving time and ensuring that the content is promptly shared with the relevant Discord community.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity
1. **Distinctiveness**:
    - **Unique Purpose**: Share Store specializes in secure file sharing and storage, setting it apart from traditional social networks or e-commerce sites.
    - **Targeted File Sharing**: Its main focus is on organized file sharing, not social interactions or product sales. The recent addition of Discord integration for file (automatic lecture slide) uploads further enhances its role as a specialized platform for content sharing.
    - **Cloudinary Integration**: Share Store integrates with Cloudinary, enhancing file management and enabling secure uploads and downloads.
2. **Complexity**:
    - **Django Backend**: Utilizes Django for user authentication, file metadata, and access control.
    - **JavaScript and Bootstrap**: Employs JavaScript and Bootstrap for a responsive frontend.
    - **User Authentication**: Implements secure user registration and login.
    - **File Management**: Handles complex tasks like file uploads, downloads, and access permissions.
